// this is not a readme, this is a note to myself.
// first install emsdk
// then make sure emsdk commands are available
// (linux):
source ./emsdk_env.sh

// I install the libraries into emsdk's default install directory using 
// "emcmake cmake" or the toolchain file (note with emcmake, you build without emcmake)
// see the build instructions for building native code if you need them.
emcmake cmake -S gltest -B wasm_build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build wasm_build

// then to test you use  (you can also specifiy the browser you installed using the docs)
emrun wasm_build/gltest.html

// details:

// to publish I rename the html file to index.html
// note that ATM the hexfont-full.hex file in demo_files is truncated to "U+1FFF" for size, 
// because it would normally be 4.4mb.

// for fullscreen, I use a external html button that calls this:
// Module.requestFullscreen(document.getElementById('pointerLock').checked,  document.getElementById('resize').checked)
// but inside the the application (because of security context) I use soft_fullscreen for alt+enter.

// for clipboards I use a external (paste/copy/cut)_clipboard functions,
// (because in SDL2, the clipboard is fake because of security context problems)
// and in javascript I would steal the ctrl+v/c/x event,
// and I would use the async API for clipboards
// which will generate a fake SDL event for CTRL+v/c/x
// (I could use asyncify, but I am worried about perf)
// the only problem is that the event will be "late" and possibly out of order, 
// but the only way to save the order is by replacing SDL's pull event system
// with a push event system (callbacks over polling, a lot of work, maybe use glfw?), 
// or using asyncify and just freeze the main loop for the clipboard.

// currently it's impossible to get IME's running... (the only way would be to replace my prompts with HTML DOM ones)
